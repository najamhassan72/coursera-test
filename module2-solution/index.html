                <p>
                    Can you go a week without Googling something? How about a day? We have Larry Page and co-founder Sergey Brin to thank for the trusty search engine. While at Stanford, Page started Google as a research project, and Brin joined in. The two soon discovered that their project could be used to build a search engine the likes of which no one had ever seen.Page officially became the CEO of Google while Schmidt continues to serve as executive chairman.

                <h2>Elon Musk</h2>
                <p>
                    Referred to as the real Iron Man, Elon Musk is probably best known as the famous CEO of Tesla Motors and SpaceX. However, he got his start with computers. At the age of 12 he began teaching himself to program which later paved the way for the launch of his first company, Zip2. But he didnâ€™t stop there. He went on to become a co-founder of a company that later became PayPal, which allowed him to strike conversations with the brain-children behind Tesla Motors.
